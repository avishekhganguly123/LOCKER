# ieee_mega_project
team name bitians.
it is web development project.
This project is based on package locker,
when any delivery guy comes and receiver is not there he can keep that package into this locker  and receiver will take that package when he/she is available 
here we use nodemailer module of node js to send email to the receiver of package in that mail a password is sent is store in a js file.
we wanted to store password in backend but couldn't do it right now.
